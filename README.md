A software that offers plotting the complexity graphs of the sorting algorithms and comparing their performance based on their complexity graphs

* The data which the app uses to calculate the algorithm complexity are either randomly generated as text file in the app's same directory 
or inserted and uploaded by the user from same directory

* User is expected to choose either to insert data or generate random values

* Packages used in this app: tkinter, matplotlib, numpy, random
